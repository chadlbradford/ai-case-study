# Case Study: AI Driven Drug Discovery and Development at Exscientia
## Overview and Development
Exscientia is a pharmaceutical discovery and development company incorporated and based in the United Kingdom beginning in 2012.  The key founder of the company is Andrew Hopkins whose experience includes a professorship at University of Dundee and 10 years of industrial experience at Pfizer, and leverages his training in chemistry, biology and physics.  Over the past 12 years, Exscientia has positioned itself as one of the premier companies utilizing AI and ML to drive drug discovery efforts for both an internal pipeline as well as partnering the technology to other large pharmaceutical companies such as Merck, Bristol-Myers Squib, Sanofi and Bayer.  These partnerships bring in revenue that is bolstered with funds raised through investment.  The company raised $26 MM, $60 MM, $225 MM and $510 MM from 2019 to an IPO in 2024.  

In 2024, Exscientia was challenged with transformational events.  The CEO Hopkins was found to have had inappropriate relationships with employees, resulting in his removal by the board of directors.  Adding to these leadership challenges, the company's financial landscape began to shift towards an unsustainable paradigm.  The combination of the loss of founding leadership and the inability to raise capital to continue operations in a cost intensive industry led to the company being vulnerable to takeover.  In November 2024, Salt Lake City based Recursion, a competitor of Exscientia in the AI/ML driven drug discovery industry, completed its business integration under the Recursion name.
## Business Activities
Discovering and developing a new drug that clearly demonstrates the proper blend of safety, efficacy and business traction involves an industry that is incredibly rich with competition.  The scientific complexity of human biology along with an immense chemical space creates a daunting path towards this therapeutic goal.  If considering a small molecule (<500 daltons) that binds to a protein to impart a modification to a disease state, there are 10^23 possible compounds to engage nearly 20,000 expressed proteins.  Over the past 50 years, a system of brute force screening was used to assess the possible combinations of target and therapeutic.  The process involved understanding the biology around a disease state, identifying target proteins whose activity can be altered to modify this state, and then painstakingly sorting through the chemical space to find an ideal candidate to continue into human clinical studies.  Generally this process takes approximately 10 years, costs >$1 B, and has a decreasing success rate in the past two decades.  

Exscientia dove into the niche of using ML to more quickly predict the biological and chemical landscape, and then efficiently generate empirical data to assess the chemical space for the diseases they or their partners were engaged in.  This was primarily in oncology although many companies including Exscientia are also in the rare disease space.   The ultimate goal of these efforts is to bring needed therapeutics to patients faster and cheaper by requiring less experimentation.  Although a human suffering from a disease is the ultimate customer, small to medium sized pharmaceutical companies have to consider partnering their technology to larger pharma companies as revenue to fund continued growth and development.  Revenue from a single partnership can potentially reach $1-2 B, although reaching all potential milestones is rarely achieved.  More typically, a partnership will result in $30-50 MM/year.  Revenue from approved drug sales varies by market size but can easily reach billions per year.

The unique technologies Exscientia uses are ML tools trained on extensive biological, chemical and physical datasets.  In initial efforts, the company uses public and private genomic data sets in combination with mass ingestion of scientific literature to predict and validate the ideal biological target.  Recently, companies in this space have access to ever-growing data sets on actual human patients.  This vastly increases the data used to train the models and further narrows the focus to the intended human patient population.    The suite of available targets is then assessed for amenability to being modified by the ideal small molecule therapeutic, again via a panel of ML based tools.  Lastly, that small molecule therapeutic can be designed in silico using predictive utilities.  This process has been shown to outperform traditional human decision pathways.  Although the use of AI and ML are increasingly common across the industry, what sets companies apart is their ability to generate or preferentially access large scale and relatable data bases with proprietary tools.  Exscientia had established itself as a leader due to its ability to generate vast amounts of phenomics data paired with industry leading predictive chemistry tools.
## Landscape
Use of AI and ML is increasingly common across the drug discovery and development industry, although there is a panel of small and medium sized companies that are championing the efforts.  There were approximately 10-15 AI/ML focused companies in the industry around 2015.  Now there are several dozen.  The largest players in the field include the aforementioned Recursion, Insilico Medicine, Atomwise, Schrodinger and Benevolent AI.  Market consolidation is being realized as evidenced by the Recursion/Exscientia integration.  In addition, large pharmaceutical companies are putting significant resources towards developing in-house AI/ML based platforms.  If success in the clinic is found, the expectation would be explosive and transformational growth across the world-wide pharmaceutical industry.
## Results
The pharmaceutical industry ultimately measures its successes by the number of therapies being approved by regulatory agencies.  To date, there is no approved therapeutic that has been generated primarily using AI/ML methodologies.  Although much criticism can be found that these efforts are not panning out, there is data to suggest that traction is being gained.  The first compounds to be brought to the clinic purely using predictive tools are now being realized.  Insilico Medicine brought the first clinical candidate to reach Phase II trials using generative AI tools in 2023.  There is an increasing number of clinical readouts that are expected over the next few years, with Recursion expecting 10 clinical readouts through 2025.  Once the number of approved AI derived drugs increases, other more impactful measures of success include improvement in health statistics (e.g. decreased mortality from cancer) and number of prescriptions issued.
## Recommendations
Although my understanding of the capabilities of AI and ML are just now being developed through this course, one aspect I fall back on is the raw data that is used.  It seems there is less emphasis on the quality, quantity and relatability of the data being put into models than the models themselves.  If companies like Exscientia do not possess the capability of generating or accessing large amounts of high quality data generated in a standardized way, then the models used to understand aspects of biology and chemistry seemingly would not have the needed predictive power.  Companies that possess capabilities in both the data generation and utilization would surely have a market advantage.
